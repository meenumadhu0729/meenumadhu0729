## About Me
Hi, I am Meenu Madhu, a Computer Engineering graduate from University of Mumbai. After completing my undergraduate studies, I joined Accenture Solutions Private Limited as a Software Engineer, which provided domain knowledge of the Retail and Telecom sectors and I learned test automation tools which included Selenium, Cucumber, and Micro Focus UFT along with test management tools. I have strived hard with dedication and perseverance to steer myself into becoming a highly competent and result-oriented software professional having about 1.8 years of experience in the area of software testing (functional) using Agile methodology, with a solid understanding of test planning, test design, and defect reporting. 
I am currently pursuing Masters in Information Techonolgy from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Australia.

## Skills
__Manual testing__
  * Performed manual functional E2E testing, sanity testing, regression testing, negative testing and unit testing.
  * Gained hands-on experience on testing applications during training period at work.

__Test Analysis & Design__
* Can analyse the design document and write test cases based on the requirements.
* Can find design defects and component design defects during the estimation and development phase prior to manual testing.

__Test Documentation__  
* Can create test cases and validation and know-how and in which situations to use them effectively.
* Able to report bug, raise defects on JIRA and know how to track them.

__Java__  
* Can write simple functions.
* Code needed to automate test case in Selenium.


## Tools
__HP ALM__
* Know how to create test cases and test suits
* Able to run created test cases and update the status

__Jira__
* Know how to raise defects, create test cases, test case ID and track them.
* Able to perform bulk uploaded for large number of test cases.
* Know how to use dashboard.

__Agile Requirement Designer__
* ARD is a tool to generate test cases automatically using model. It is used for easy understanding of test cases by business and stake holders.
* With the help of ARD, we can create Behavioural driven development (BDD) scripts.
* Know how to use create model and can build model with test cases and validation for requirements.

__Tomcat__
* Ran selenium automation scripts using this application as a part of automation testing.

__Postman__
* Performed API testing using Postman.

## Work Experience
__Trainings__
* Got trained in manual and automation testing on below mentioned tools.
* Used project management tools like HP ALM and JIRA
* Got trained in Selenium, Cucumber, Micro focus UFT

__Projects__
* Identified discrepancies across the Requirement and design in the testing life cycle. Thus increase the quality standards of the Requirements & Design and would reduce the requirement level changes during the E2E Testing phase.
* Engaged with the Business Owners, Stakeholders & CE Leads as part of the review process and work closely with them to fix the discrepancies in RA phase
* Create TDD scripts on JIRA based on the requirement.
* Estimate the efforts and update the UTP points of the story on JIRA.
* Identify new interfaces impacted in the requirement to establish connectivity between multiple components for testing new functionality and check for stub impacts.
* Create TDD scripts on JIRA based on the requirement.
* Prepared test cases based on HLD and LLD for better coverage of testing. HLD is high level design made for requirement and LLD (Low level design) is for component level design.
* Identified the complexity, environment and data need to run each test cases with proper validation and steps to perform each scenario.
* Identify dependency on third party suppliers involved in the project,
* Prepared data to perform the test before testing starts.
* Given handover of test pack and the requirement to testers and performed the testing.
* Raised defects on JIRA and tracked the bug until the issue was resolved
* Gave final sign-off once testing is fully completed so it can Go-Live.
